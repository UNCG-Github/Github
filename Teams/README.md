# GITHUB TEAMS

## OVERVIEW

[Before going any further, please read Github's documentation about "teams"](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/about-teams).

Organization owners can set up teams that are managed directly inside of Github, or optionally the team can be kept in sync with a UNCG Azure AD group. 

Administrators have already set up the [sync process](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-saml-single-sign-on-for-your-organization/managing-team-synchronization-for-your-organization), meaning for exsiting groups it's just a simple process of selecting it from a drop-down menu inside your Team Settings.

## CONNECTING TO AN EXISTING UNCG AZURE AD GROUP

Information about setting up a team to be synchronized is [provided by Github here](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/synchronizing-a-team-with-an-identity-provider-group).

## DON'T HAVE A UNCG AZURE AD GROUP YET?

#### (A) The group/team only need to exist inside Github
- If the group is only going to be used inside Github and no other services, you may contact UNCG Github Admins for assistance. 
- Submit an "issue" and use the "team sync" template.
- Administrators will review and help get things set up within 2-3 business days.

#### (B) The group/team needs to integrate with Github AND other services
If the group is going to be used to integrate with other services (Google Shared Drives, Google Groups, Canvas Organizations, MS Teams etc):
 - Contact ITS Identity Management through [6-TECH](http://6tech.uncg.edu) to get your group set up. 
 - After set up, the group(s) will appear in Github for you to select as a source for your team [per the instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/synchronizing-a-team-with-an-identity-provider-group).
