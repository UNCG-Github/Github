# GITHUB TEAMS

## OVERVIEW

[Before going any further, please read Github's documentation about "teams"](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/about-teams).

Organization owners can set up teams that are managed directly inside of Github, or optionally the team can be kept in sync with a UNCG Azure AD group. 

Administrators have already set up the [sync process](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-saml-single-sign-on-for-your-organization/managing-team-synchronization-for-your-organization), meaning for exsiting groups it's just a simple process of selecting it from a drop-down menu inside your Team Settings.

## CONNECTING TO AN EXISTING UNCG AZURE AD GROUP

Information about setting up a team to be synchronized is [provided by Github here](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/synchronizing-a-team-with-an-identity-provider-group).

## DON'T HAVE A UNCG AZURE AD GROUP YET?

 - Groups can be used to sync members into other services like Google Groups, Canvas Orgs etc, so the recommendation is to create a group for the distinct population you need to manage, and then you can use it with various services.
 - Contact ITS Identity Management through [6-TECH](http://6tech.uncg.edu) to get your group(s) set up. 
 - After set up (usually within 24 hours) the group(s) will appear in Github for you to select as a source for your team [per the instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/synchronizing-a-team-with-an-identity-provider-group).
