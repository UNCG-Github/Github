## Github Actions @ UNCG

Before reading any further, please ensure you have read and understand what Github Actions are via [Github's Documentation for Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)

Github Actions are **disabled by default** for all Github @ UNCG Organizations.

Organization Owners may request enablement by [submitting an Issue](https://github.com/UNCG-Github/Github/issues/new/choose) (using the template provided).

Organization Owners are responsible for **all costs** incurred by their organization's usage of Actions. 

Github provides a free/included amount of actions, but anything above and beyond that limit will be billed back to the Owner/Department.

Support for Github Actions is provided through Github documentation and the community at large. 

**No support is provided by the Github @ UNCG Administrators,** other than initial enablment of the feature for the specific organization(s) that request and are approved to use this feature.
