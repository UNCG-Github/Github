## Accessing Github @ UNCG 

Repositories that are part of Github @ UNCG may be:
 - Public: Accessible to anyone on the internet, without need for a Github account
 - Internal: Accessible to all UNCG users
 - Private: Accessible only to specific individuals

In order to access an "Internal" or "Private" repository, users must:
 - [ ] Have an active Github account with 2FA enabled AND 
 - [ ] Be invited to a Github @ UNCG repository, organization or project

Here's a basic overview of how the process will work for most people:

1. Sally Student already has a github account that she set up for herself a while ago, but Frank Faculty does not have a Github account at all.
2. Regina, who owns a UNCG Git repository wants to work with Sally and Frank, so Regina invites them via their UNCG email addresses
3. Sally and Frank both receive an email invitation that includes details and a button to accept the invite
4. Sally clicks the button, signs into her github account and then is redirected to sign into her UNCG account through Azure (just like signing into Gmail, Zoom, or Canvas).
5. Frank clicks the link, and follows the Github instructions for how to [create a new github account](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/signing-up-for-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account). Once he's done that (including setting up [2FA](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa)) he is also redirected to sign into his UNCG account, just like Gmail or Zoom.
7. Sally and Frank can now start collaborating with Regina on the code in the organizations or repositories that they were invited to.  

## Outside Collaborators

Organization, project, and repository owners can collaborate with people outside UNCG, using the "[Outside Collaborator](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/adding-outside-collaborators-to-repositories-in-your-organization)" feature of Github. [Outside Collaborators](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/adding-outside-collaborators-to-repositories-in-your-organization) will be required to have Github [2FA enabled](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa) on their account, but will not need to login using an iSpartan username/password.

In order to access a Github @ UNCG repository as an outside collaborator, the outside person must:
 - [ ] Have an active Github account with 2FA enabled AND 
 - [ ] Be invited to a Github @ UNCG repository, organization or project AND
 - [ ] Be listed by the repository or organization owner as an outside collaborator
