# GitHub @ UNCG

## Overview

UNCG manages an enterprise version of GitHub hosted in the cloud, available for use by students, faculty, staff, and their collaborators.

GitHub is a service for collaborating on software and documentation projects. It provides version control, issue tracking, and wiki space for hosted projects. GitHub uses Git, a distributed version control system used in the Linux kernel, the Android mobile platform, and other projects.
