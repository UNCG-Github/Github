# GitHub @ UNCG

## Overview

UNCG manages an enterprise version of GitHub hosted in the cloud, available for use by students, faculty, staff, and their collaborators.

GitHub is a service for collaborating on software and documentation projects. It provides version control, issue tracking, and wiki space for hosted projects. GitHub uses Git, a distributed version control system used in the Linux kernel, the Android mobile platform, and other projects.

Github provides free services to anyone on the internet, meaning UNCG faculty, staff, and students can access public projects directly not through UNCG if they choose. However, Git projects that are part of Github @ UNCG are subject to additional security and access controls.

Github for UNCG is provided at no cost, as long as requirements are met by each organization and their "champion. See below for more information about orgs and champions.

## Github Organizations

Github @ UNCG is split into multiple "Organizations." Organizations are distinct shared areas where groups can collaborate across many projects at once. Organization administrators can manage member access to their org's data and projects, without having to coordinate with a central Github Administrator.

All Organizations must have at least one designated owner commonly referred to as their "github champion." Champions are responsible for their organization, and are required to attend training or other mandated events as part of the Github service. 

UNCG faculty, staff, and students can request an organization by:
 1. Create a new "Issue" for this repository.
 2. Use the Organization Request template provided
 3. Complete the template, filling in all sections to the best of your ability. 
 4. Submit the issue. A Github Administrator will respond to your issue with questions, or instructions

## Access

UNCG faculty, staff and students can access github using their iSpartan username and password.
