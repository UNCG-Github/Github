# GitHub @ UNCG

## Overview

UNCG manages an enterprise version of GitHub hosted in the cloud, available for use by students, faculty, staff, and their collaborators.

GitHub is a service for collaborating on software and documentation projects. It provides version control, issue tracking, and wiki space for hosted projects. GitHub uses Git, a distributed version control system used in the Linux kernel, the Android mobile platform, and other projects.

Github provides free services to anyone on the internet, meaning UNCG faculty, staff, and students can access public projects directly (not through UNCG) if they choose. However, Git projects that are part of Github @ UNCG are subject to additional security and access controls.

The Github service is provided at no cost, as long as requirements are met by each organization owner. There are potential costs involved if an organization permits "Github Actions" but this can be discussed with Github Administrators before Actions are enabled.

## Access to Github

UNCG faculty, staff and students can access github using their iSpartan username and password. 

Two Factor Authentication (2FA) is required for Github @ UNCG accounts. Information on [configuring your account for 2FA is available here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa).

You can interact with github within a web browser, or via another machine with Git software installed. If Git is not already installed, download it from one of the following locations, depending on your operating system:
 - [Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
 - [Mac](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)
 - [Linux](https://www.git-scm.com/download/linux)
 - [Git Desktop](https://desktop.github.com)

## Github Organizations

Github @ UNCG is split into multiple "Organizations." Organizations are distinct shared areas where groups can collaborate across many projects at once. Organization administrators can manage member access to their org's data and projects, without having to coordinate with a central Github Administrator.

All Organizations must have at least one designated owner. Owners are responsible for their organization, and are required to attend training or other mandated events as part of the Github service. Organizations that do not have an active UNCG owner, may be scheduled for removal/deletion.
