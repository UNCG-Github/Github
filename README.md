# GitHub @ UNCG

## Overview

GitHub is a service for collaborating on software and documentation projects. It provides version control, issue tracking, and wiki space for hosted projects. GitHub uses Git, a distributed version control system used in the Linux kernel, the Android mobile platform, and other projects.

Github provides free services to anyone on the internet, meaning UNCG faculty, staff, and students can access public projects directly (not through UNCG) if they choose. However, Git projects that are part of the Github @ UNCG enterprise service are subject to additional security and access controls.

UNCG provides an enterprise version of GitHub hosted in the cloud that is available for use by students, faculty, staff, and their outside collaborators. The Github service is provided at no cost, as long as requirements are met by each organization owner. There are potential costs involved if an ownner requests and then permits "[Github Actions](Actions)" for their organization, but this can be discussed with Github Administrators before [Actions](Actions) are enabled.

## Accessing Github @ UNCG

Organization or repository owners can invite any UNCG faculty, staff and students using their UNCG email address. Invited people then access Github using their iSpartan username and password. Outside (non-UNCG) collaborators are also permitted on an Organization-by-Organization basis.

#### Git software
You can interact with github within a web browser, or via another machine with Git software installed. If Git is not already installed, download it from one of the following locations, depending on your operating system:
 - [Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
 - [Mac](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)
 - [Linux](https://www.git-scm.com/download/linux)
 - [Git Desktop](https://desktop.github.com)

## Github Organizations

The [Github @ UNCG Enterprise](https://github.com/enterprises/unc-greensboro) is split into multiple "Organizations." Organizations are distinct shared areas where groups can collaborate across many projects at once. Organization administrators can manage member access to their org's data and projects, without having to coordinate with a central Github Administrator.

All Organizations must have at least one designated owner. Owners are responsible for their organization, and are required to attend training or other mandated events as part of the Github service. Organizations that do not have an active UNCG owner, may be scheduled for removal/deletion.

## Teams
Teams may be set up inside Github @ UNCG. These can be ad-hoc managed in github, or sync'd with an existing UNCG Azure AD Group. [See here for more details](Teams).

## Data Classification

Github should not be used to store passwords/secrets or other sensitive data. Organization owners will set the data classification guidance for their organization, based on discussion with the relevant data steward(s).
