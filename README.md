## Overview

GitHub is a service for collaborating on software and documentation projects. It provides version control, issue tracking, and wiki space for hosted projects. GitHub uses Git, a distributed version control system used in the Linux kernel, the Android mobile platform, and other projects.

Github provides free services to anyone on the internet, meaning UNCG faculty, staff, and students can access public projects directly (not through UNCG) if they choose. However, Git projects that are part of the Github @ UNCG enterprise service are subject to additional security and access controls.

UNCG provides an enterprise version of GitHub hosted in the cloud and is available for use by students, faculty, staff, and their outside collaborators. The Github service is provided at no cost, as long as requirements are met by each organization owner. There are potential costs involved if an organization permits "[Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)" but this can be discussed with Github Administrators before [Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) are enabled.

## Access to Github

UNCG faculty, staff and students can access github using their iSpartan username and password. 

Two Factor Authentication (2FA) is required for Github @ UNCG accounts. Information on [configuring your account for 2FA is available here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa).

#### Collaboration outside UNCG

Organization, project, and repository owners can collaborate with people outside UNCG, using the "[Outside Collaborator](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/adding-outside-collaborators-to-repositories-in-your-organization)" feature of Github. [Outside Collaborators](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/adding-outside-collaborators-to-repositories-in-your-organization) will be required to have Github [2FA enabled](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa) on their account, but will not need to login using an iSpartan username/password.

#### Git software
You can interact with github within a web browser, or via another machine with Git software installed. If Git is not already installed, download it from one of the following locations, depending on your operating system:
 - [Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
 - [Mac](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)
 - [Linux](https://www.git-scm.com/download/linux)
 - [Git Desktop](https://desktop.github.com)

## Github Organizations

Github @ UNCG is split into multiple "Organizations." Organizations are distinct shared areas where groups can collaborate across many projects at once. Organization administrators can manage member access to their org's data and projects, without having to coordinate with a central Github Administrator.

All Organizations must have at least one designated owner. Owners are responsible for their organization, and are required to attend training or other mandated events as part of the Github service. Organizations that do not have an active UNCG owner, may be scheduled for removal/deletion.

[Click here for the the detailed Organization Request Process](/Organizations/Organization_Request_Process.md). 

## Data Classification

Github should not be used to store passwords/secrets or other sensitive data. Organization owners will set the data classification guidance for their organization, based on discussion with the relevant data steward(s).

## Support

Support is provided by Github @ UNCG administrators for the following topics:
 - Access & Authentication
 - Organization Creation
 
Support requests related to the following topics are handled by each Org Owner, or will be directed to [Github's documentation](https://docs.github.com):
 - Organization Policies & Configuration
 - General repository or project usage & configuration
 - General git usage (installation, push, pull, clone, pull requests, rebasing, branching, tagging etc)
 - Github "actions"
 - Git errors
 - Other miscellaneous issues
